I'm planning to release a series of blog posts walking out Bayesian power analysis. It'll be based around using simulations with [**brms**](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) models. The current plan is to release the content in 5 posts:

* Part I: Intro to simulation, focus on rejecting the null
* Part II: Alternative approach: focusing on interval widths
* Part III: Putting Gauss aside to explore models with Poison and binomial likelihoods
* Part IV: Introduction to simulations with multilevel models
* Part V: Using frequentist simulations to inform Bayesian simulations

Here you can find the `.Rmd` and `.md` files for each part. Unfortunately, `github_document` files still do a poor job rendering LaTeX equations. So please forgive those; they'll look better once I move the posts over to my blog.

In the meantime, constructive peer-reviews are welcome!
